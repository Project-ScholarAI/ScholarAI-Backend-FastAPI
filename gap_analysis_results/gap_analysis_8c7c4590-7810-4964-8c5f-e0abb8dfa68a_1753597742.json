The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark specifically exposed this challenge by demonstrating that NNs struggle to systematically test and improve their ability to retain and utilize information as problem instances grow in complexity and demand increasing memory capacities. Existing solutions, largely based on fixed-context attention mechanisms or recurrent units, prove insufficient because they do not gracefully scale with the unbounded or vastly expanding memory requirements of real-world problems and complex algorithmic tasks, often leading to catastrophic forgetting or poor generalization when data dependencies span long temporal or structural distances.",

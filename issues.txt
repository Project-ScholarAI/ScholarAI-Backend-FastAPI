# High priority
1. only arxiv is fully working but citations are mostly 0 and these are arxiv version so low accuracy metadata.

# Medium priority
1. cross ref, pubmed, openalex, europe pmc, bioarxiv, DOAJ api client doesn't provide direct pdf url and we cannot get the pdf.
2. Fore core api client everything works except shows invalid pdf structure for pdf viewer.

# Low priority
1. semantic scholar times out and doesn't work
2. unpaywall, DBLP, Base mostly no paper found
